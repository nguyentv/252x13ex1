This is my attempt at Exam 1

I went through w3 schools and youtube tutorials to get this, but I still can't figure out how to link csv back to drop down menu box.
I included the code that I did to try and make it work. It seems to work in Firefox, but Internet Explorer will not do the states drop down menu
like I want it to.
